1. The calculations by my program show significant effects of the fairness of the Naive Bayesian network, particularly concerning gender bias. Evidently, 99.96% of women in the test set have a higher probability of earning ≥$50K when gender is excluded (E1) compared to when it is included (E2). While on the other hand, men show no similar data, with 0% salary decrease experience. This stark difference suggests that the model inherently disadvantages women by reducing their predicted salary probabilities when gender is considered, indicating potential bias. Additionally, the model assigns a higher probablity of earning ≥$50K to men (25.42%) compared to women (8.06%) overall, further proving that this model is unfair to one gender. While the accuracy for predicting actual high salaries is somewhat comparable, 57.32% for women and 66.30% for men, thid unreasonable treatment based on gender undermines the model's fairness.

2. Given these findings, I would hesitate to use this model for recommending starting salaries at a firm. The obvious gender bias not only raises ethical concerns but also risks inequality within any workplace, hurting empolyees and harming company image and policies. A fair and reliable salary recommendation system must make sure that predictions are free from biases like this, to ensure equal opportunities regardless of gender. Therefore, the model requires significant changes to address and eliminate these fairness and gender bias issues before it can be used in a workplace or other real-world situations.
